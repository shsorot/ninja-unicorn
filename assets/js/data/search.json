With this post I would like to dig into one possible scenario on how such an extension can look like focusing on the “new” players and see where there are pitfalls or issues be it because of combining SAP and Microsoft or due to problems in one or the other platform itself."

Not only it is the last one from the series, but I’m going to show you some cool features around data extraction that pushed me into writing the whole series. Since I have started working on the series, it was the main topic I wanted to describe. Initially, I planned to cover it as part of my Your SAP on Azure series that I’m running for the last couple of years. But as there are many intriguing concepts in OData-based extraction, and I wanted to show you as much as I can, I decided to run a separate set of posts. I hope you enjoyed it and learnt something new."

I already explained how crucial is extraction optimization. The created Synapse Pipeline can use client-side paging to chunk a large request into several smaller ones. In the last episode, we focused on data filtering to copy only the required information. Both solutions improve the performance and reliability of the extraction, but a full data copy is not always an answer. It is not uncommon to have millions or even billions of records in the largest tables. A daily extraction job to copy everything is pretty much impossible in such scenarios. It would take too much time and cause performance challenges on SAP application servers. Multiple extractions every day could cause even more problems."

This includes single sign-on (SSO) from Teams and end-to-end principal propagation with the Azure AD-authenticated user when accessing the product data in the backend system. You can find the complete source code of the bot in GitHub. The dialog between the user and the bot is implemented as a Waterfall dialog from the SDK by defining the series of steps to collect information from the user and to guide her through a series of tasks."

With this 3rd part of the blog series, you will build a distributed cloud application with different components running in Azure, BTP and SAP backend on-premise. From an end-user perspective, this application offers a chat bot interface in Microsoft Teams, which allows to search for IT equipment in a product catalogue. The product data such as price, category and an image is retrieved from the SAP backend system, where access control is enforced based on the Azure AD-authenticated user’s authorizations.

This can be conveniently achieved by consuming OData-services of the SAP Netweaver Gateway Server with a Logic App. To make this demo easily reproducible, the public SAP Gateway demo system E5 is used. For productive scenarios utilizing interfaces like IDoc, BAPI, or RFC the new Azure Logic Apps SAP Connector is recommended.This document will describe the required step to enable the OData-based consumption of changed records in a SAP S/4HANA system."

This includes applying and mapping the SAP ABAP authorizations of the same user-logged on to Azure AD and maintained in SAP NW.As a result, this approach allows to reuse existing SAP NW security, authorization- and role-concepts within Azure based applications like the Azure Bot demonstrated in this example."

This architectural style enables them to rapidly respond to market conditions. However, such highly distributed systems also come with costs, e.g. for their increased communication overhead and additional operational complexity. Quite often, those services are not deployed in a single system landscape. They are distributed across different regions, geographies (e.g. for availability and performance reasons), or even clouds. In such a multi-cloud setup with multiple platforms from different vendors, interoperability and standards become an important aspect to consider when designing a solution. This is especially true for the security of the solution from an end-to-end perspective."
